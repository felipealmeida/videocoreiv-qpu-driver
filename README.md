# QPU driver from raspberry pi ARM core

This is a github project to attempt for the goal of fullfilling the raspberry pi foundation bounty - Quake 3 demo running at 20fps, without using the binary GPU blob for controlling the V3D unit.

Currently, it contains the entire set of files broadcom released, in an open, easy to explore format.
